[Atom] + [GitKraken]
====================
Open the current [Atom] project in _[GitKraken]_.

This can be activated from the _Packages_ menu, _command palette_, from the context menu on the root project folder in _tree view_, or the git _branch_ indicator in the _status bar_. <kbd>⌥</kbd> or <kbd>⇧</kbd> click will also work here.

An instance of _GitKraken_ will be spawned for each project by default, but can be configured in the package settings to only ever run a single instance of the application.

Install
-------
`apm install gitkraken` or search “kraken” under packages within Atom.
